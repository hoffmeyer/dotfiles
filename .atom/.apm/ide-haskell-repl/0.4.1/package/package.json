You can choose `none` builder to use `ghci` in plain projects (a.k.a. projects with no `*.cabal` file).\n\nIf `ide-haskell-cabal` is unavailable (e.g. disabled), ide-haskell-repl will fall back to `defaultRepl` specified in settings.\n\n## Repl-specific commands\n\nTo send command, or move through history, you can use the following commands when focused on repl command editor:\n\n* `ide-haskell-repl:exec-command`\n* `ide-haskell-repl:history-back`\n* `ide-haskell-repl:history-forward`\n* `ide-haskell-repl:ghci-reload`\n\nNote that this commands are bound specifically to repl editor, which has CSS selector of `atom-text-editor.ide-haskell-repl`.\n\nYou can rebind those in your keymap, e.g.\n\n```\n\"atom-text-editor.ide-haskell-repl\":\n  'ctrl-enter': 'ide-haskell-repl:exec-command'\n  'ctrl-up': 'ide-haskell-repl:history-back'\n  'ctrl-down': 'ide-haskell-repl:history-forward'\n```\n\nJust don't forget to disable default bindings in ide-haskell-repl settings, if you don't want them.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/atom-haskell/ide-haskell-repl/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/atom-haskell/ide-haskell-repl#readme","_id":"ide-haskell-repl@0.4.1","_shasum":"6ba802113ada24325c24331b67b4fd16b56c2ff7","_resolved":"file:../d-116922-92062-582g39/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116922-92062-582g39/package.tgz"}
