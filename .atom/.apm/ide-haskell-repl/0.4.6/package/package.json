You can choose `none` builder to use `ghci` in plain projects (a.k.a. projects with no `*.cabal` file).\n\nIf `ide-haskell-cabal` is unavailable (e.g. disabled), ide-haskell-repl will fall back to `defaultRepl` specified in settings.\n\n## Using on Windows\n\nOn Windows, interrupting ghci will kill it. There is no good solution to this problem at the moment, but there is a \"bad\" solution.\n\nYou need to get `ghci-wrapper.exe` executable from https://github.com/atom-haskell/win-ghci-wrapper/releases (or if you don't trust random binaries you've downloaded from the Internet, you can build it from source -- you only really need ghc for that)\n\nThen you need to specify full path to this executable in `ghciWrapperPath` setting of this package.\n\nFor example, if you placed `ghci-wrapper.exe` in `C:\\Downloads` directory, you need to put `C:\\Downloads\\ghci-wrapper.exe` in `ghciWrapperPath` setting.\n\nFinally, restart any open REPL sessions.\n\n## Repl-specific commands\n\nTo send command, or move through history, you can use the following commands when focused on repl command editor:\n\n* `ide-haskell-repl:exec-command`\n* `ide-haskell-repl:history-back`\n* `ide-haskell-repl:history-forward`\n* `ide-haskell-repl:ghci-reload`\n\nNote that this commands are bound specifically to repl editor, which has CSS selector of `atom-text-editor.ide-haskell-repl`.\n\nYou can rebind those in your keymap, e.g.\n\n```\n\"atom-text-editor.ide-haskell-repl\":\n  'ctrl-enter': 'ide-haskell-repl:exec-command'\n  'ctrl-up': 'ide-haskell-repl:history-back'\n  'ctrl-down': 'ide-haskell-repl:history-forward'\n```\n\nJust don't forget to disable default bindings in ide-haskell-repl settings, if you don't want them.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/atom-haskell/ide-haskell-repl/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/atom-haskell/ide-haskell-repl#readme","_id":"ide-haskell-repl@0.4.6","_shasum":"413ac51d914126a195d4cdbf1f2d567423f8f930","_resolved":"file:../d-1161113-78184-1i4032n/package.tgz","_from":"../d-1161113-78184-1i4032n/package.tgz"}
