For each GHC version you can specify:\n\n* The path (either adding to your system path or replacing it completely)\n* The sandbox file (cabal `CABAL_SANDBOX_CONFIG` environment variable)\n* The build directory (cabal `--builddir` parameter). This defaults to `dist/`.\n\nIt also provides support for `ide-haskell`'s build target selection by reading and parsing the `.cabal` file and extracting the available targets (it uses a thin `ghcjs`-compiled wrapper around the `Cabal` library to read the .`cabal` file).\n\n## Keybindings\n\nIde-Haskell-Cabal comes with little pre-specified keybindings, so you will need to specify your own, if you want those.\n\nYou can edit Atom keybindings by opening 'Edit â†’ Open Your Keymap'.
